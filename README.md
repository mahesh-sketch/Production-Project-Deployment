## Step 2: Allocate Elastic IP Address üåê

1. **Navigate to Elastic IPs:**
 - In the EC2 dashboard, click on "Elastic IPs" in the left sidebar.

2. **Allocate New Address:**
 - Click on "Allocate Elastic IP address."
 - Choose "Amazon's pool" for the allocation method.
 - Click "Allocate."

3. **Associate Elastic IP:**

 - Click "Actions" and choose "Associate Elastic IP address."

4. **Associate with Instance:**
 - Choose the instance you created.
 - Click "Associate."

5. **View Updated Public IP:**
 - Go back to the EC2 dashboard.
 - Check your instance's details to find the updated Public IP.

## Step 3: Connect to EC2 Instance Using SSH Client on Windows üíª

1. **Open Windows Terminal:**
 - Open Windows Terminal on your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory with Key Pair:**
 - Change your working directory to the location where your key pair (`YourKeyPairName.pem`) is stored.


3. **Copy SSH Command from AWS Console:**
 - In the AWS Console, navigate to your EC2 instance details.
 - Copy the SSH command provided.

4. **Paste and Run SSH Command in Windows Terminal:**
 - Paste the copied command into your Windows Terminal.

    ```bash
    ssh -i "YourKeyPairName.pem" ubuntu@your-elastic-ip 
    ```

   - Press Enter to execute the command.

5. **SSH into Your EC2 Instance:**
 - You should now be connected to your EC2 instance via SSH.

## Step 4: Install Node and NPM üöö

1. **Download and Install Node.js:**
 - Execute the following command to download and run the NodeSource setup script, adding the Node.js repository:

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
    ```

2. **Install Node.js and NPM:**
 - Install Node.js and NPM by running:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install nodejs
    ```

3. **Check Node.js Version:**
 - Verify the installation by checking the Node.js version:

    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
 - The displayed version confirms a successful installation.

## Step 5: Clone Your Project from GitHub üîÑ

    git clone <Repositories Link>

## Step 6: Install Dependencies and Test App üì¶

1. **Install PM2 globally (if not installed):**
 - Use the following command to install PM2 globally. This command checks if PM2 is already installed; if not, it installs it:

    ```bash
    sudo npm install pm2 -g
    ```

 - PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications, ensuring they run continuously.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
 - Change your current working directory to the directory where your project is located. Replace `short-url-nodejs` with your actual project directory:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project/short-url-nodejs
    ```

3. **Start the App with PM2:**
 - Start your Node.js app using PM2. Replace `index` with the entry file of your application:

    ```bash
    pm2 start index
    ```

 - PM2 will manage your application, keeping it running in the background.

4. **PM2 Commands for Managing the App:**
 - Use the following commands to manage your app with PM2:

    ```bash
    pm2 show app
    pm2 status
    pm2 restart app
    pm2 stop app
    pm2 logs   # Show log stream
    pm2 flush  # Clear logs

    # To ensure the app starts when the system reboots
    pm2 startup ubuntu
    ```
## Step 7: Setup Firewall üõ°Ô∏è

1. **Update Inbound Rules in Security Group:**
 - Go to the AWS EC2 Dashboard.
 - Click on "Security Groups" in the left sidebar.
 - Select the security group associated with your EC2 instance.

 - Edit the inbound rules and add two custom TCP rules for your application's port (replace `your-port-number`):
    - **Rule 1:** Allow incoming traffic from any IPv4 address:
    - Type: Custom TCP
    - Port Range: your-port-number
    - Source: 0.0.0.0/0

    - **Rule 2:** Allow incoming traffic from any IPv6 address:
    - Type: Custom TCP
    - Port Range: your-port-number
    - Source: ::/0

2. **Check if Your App is Running:**
- Open your web browser and enter the following URL with your EC2 instance's public IP address:

    ```
    http://your-ec2-public-ip:your-port-number
    ```

- Replace `your-ec2-public-ip` with the actual public IP address of your EC2 instance, and `your-port-number` with the port your application is running on.

- If your app is running, you should see your application's interface or a response.

## Step 8: Install NGINX and Configure üåê

1. **Install NGINX:**
 - Run the following command to install NGINX:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install nginx
    ```

2. **Configure NGINX:**
 - Open the NGINX default configuration file for editing:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    ```

 - Add the following configuration to the `location` part of the `server` block. Replace `yourdomain.com` and `www.yourdomain.com` with your actual domain, and update the `proxy_pass` with your app's port:

    ```nginx
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:your-app-port;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
    ```

3. **Check NGINX Configuration:**
 - Run the following command to check the NGINX configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo nginx -t
    ```

   - This ensures that the NGINX configuration is correct.

4. **Restart NGINX:**
 - Restart NGINX to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    sudo nginx -s reload
    ```
## Step 9: Add SSL with Let's Encrypt üîí

1. **Add Certbot Repository:**
 - Add the Certbot repository to your system:

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
    ```

2. **Update Package List:**
 - Update the package list to include the Certbot packages:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

3. **Install Certbot and NGINX Plugin:**
 - Install Certbot and the NGINX plugin for automatic certificate configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx
    ```

4. **Obtain SSL Certificates:**
 - Obtain SSL certificates for your domain and its subdomains. Replace `yourdomain.com` and `www.yourdomain.com` with your actual domain:

    ```bash
    sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
    ```

5. **Test Certificate Renewal Process:**
 - Certificates from Let's Encrypt are valid for 90 days. Test the renewal process with the following command:

    ```bash
    certbot renew --dry-run
    ```

 - This ensures that the renewal process works correctly.


Your website should now be deployed and accessible securely with SSL.üåü
